Custom Workflows can be created based on specific conditions to customize the 
development process in unique and creative ways

Examples of event-driven workflows include automatically running tests when code is
pushed or automatically deploying a new version of software when a new release is 
created

Github actions can build, test, and deploy Docker Containers from within your 
repository. It is like having your own shipping container port right in your codebase

Docker and Github actions ensure that your code runs consistently, no matter where it 
is deployed

MarketPlace:
    - GitHub Actions MarketPlace contains plethora of useful actions for automating 
    workflows
    - You can find actions for almost everything, from running tests to deploying 
    code to the cloud
    - Developers are constantly creating new actions and sharing them with the 
    community, so there's always something to try

You can share custom actions with others in the Github community or keep them private
for use within your team

Security and Compliance:
    - Built in security features like secrets management, automatic security updates and
    code scanning keep code safe
    - Third party security tools like Snyk and SonarCloud work with Github's 
    security features 
    - Compliance features like access control, audit logging and policy enforcement are
    like a strict but fair teacher watching your code

Insight and Analytics:
    - It make workflows better as it measures the performance and success of your 
    workflows with insights
    - Get valuable insights into what's working and what's not
    - It tells which workflow needs improvement
    - See job time, failures and resource intensive tasks with insights
    - Optimize workflow and make them run smoothly with insights

GitHub Events:
    - Triggers for running tests, deploying code or sending notifications to team
    members
    - Trigger Events:
        - Pull Request:
            - when pull request is opened or updated in a repository
            - it indicates that changes are ready for review and merging
        - Push:
            - when code is pushed to a repository
            - Either through commit or branch update
        - Issue:
            - when an issue is opened or updated in a repository
            - indicates that there is a problem or feature request is that needs to be
            addressed
        - Pull Request Review:
            - When a review is submitted on a pull request 
            - indicates that the changes have been reviewed and approved or rejected
        - Repository Dispatch:
            - When a custom webhook is triggered by a repository
        - Pull Request Review comment:
            - When a comment is made on a review of a pull request
        - Issue Comment:
            - When a comment is made on a issue
        - Workflow Run:
            - When a workflow is manually triggered or when it is triggered by another
            event in the workflow
        - Release:
            - When a new release is published in the repository
